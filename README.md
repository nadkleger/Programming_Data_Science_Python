# Programming-Data-Science-Python

This is a repository containing all projects for the Udacity Nanodegree of "Programming for Data Science with Python".

## Project No. 1

### Overview

In this project, you will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of your project submission, you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

To pass this project follow the instructions below to create a presentation. You will submit a zip file with two items:

- Slide Deck (4 slides)
- Text File with SQL queries

Your presentation should include:

- Four slides
- One question on each slide
- One visualization (graph / chart / table) per slide
- A 1-2 sentence answer to the question, based on the data and visualization, on each slide
- Indicate which code in the attached text file was used to create the visualization OR add the query used to generate the visualization.

### Project Submission

[Project Submission](https://github.com/nadkleger/Programming_Data_Science_Python/blob/master/Project1/SQL%20Project%20Submission.pdf).

## Project 2

### Overview

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Project Submission

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.

#### Files Used

There are three required files for running this program: 

* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv


## Project 3

It's time to put what you've learned about version control and GitHub into practice! In this project, you'll be simulating a realistic workflow to refactor your previous BikeShare project using Git. Here's an overview of your tasks for this project.

- Set Up Your Repository
- Improve Documentation
- Refactor Code
- Merge Branches
- Submission

### Project Submission

The Project Submission consisted in the filling of a template with all the Git commands used to perform the requested tasks.
